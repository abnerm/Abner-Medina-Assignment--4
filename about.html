			<h1>Joseph Mallord William Turner</h1>
			<p>Born in London, England. Turner, even at his early age was said to be
			headed for great success as a painter. His skill is unique and he is
			on the favorites in British History. He is mostly known for his great
			talent with color and light. One of very few painters to really personalize
			his paintings by getting his hand dirty with paint, which was something that
			was frowned upon in his time. Turner was one to not care about what critics
			thought was correct</p>
			<p>Turner is of great inspiration in many areas. Turner enjoyed what he did and
			was never afraid of painting with his own personal. He grew up in a rought 
			atmosphere. That aided to his own uniqueness.
